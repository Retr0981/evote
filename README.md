<br>

Have you ever wondered how exactly the votes in a presidential election 
counted? What if instead of having volunteers that are spending hours a 
day counting votes manually, we have an app that was backed by blockchain, 
recording each vote made by a voter, ensuring double-voting is not possible?
That's what this code pattern explains how to do. We aim to build a web-app
in which the voter can register with their drivers license, get a unique 
voterId which is used to login to the app, and cast the vote. The vote is 
tallied on the blockchain, and the web-app shows the current standings of the
polls. 

### Voting using Public Key Infrastructure
At the start of the application, the user registers to vote by providing their drivers license number,
registrar district, and first and last name. In this step, we can check to see if the drivers license 
is valid, and has not been registered previously. If all goes well, we create a private and public key 
for the voter with our certificate authority that is running on the cloud, and add those keys to the 
wallet. To read more about public key infrastructure, and how Hyperledger Fabric implements identity
using this technology, go [here](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/identity/identity.html).

After that, we use our drivers license number to submit our vote, during which the application checks 
if this drivers license number has voted before and tells the user they have already submitted a vote 
if so. If all goes well, the political party which the voter has chosen is given a vote, and the world
state is updated. The application then updates our current standings of the election to show how many 
votes each political party currently has. 

Since each transaction that is submitted to the ordering service must have a signature from a valid
public-private key pair, we can trace back each transaction to a registered voter of the application, 
in the case of an audit.

In conclusion, although this is a simple application, the developer can see how they can implement a 
Hyperledger Fabric web-app to decrease the chance of election-meddling, and enhance a voting application
by using blockchain technology. 

When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

* Create, build, and use the IBM Blockchain Platform service.
* Build a blockchain back-end using Hyperledger Fabric API's
* Create and use a (free) Kubernetes Cluster to deploy and monitor our 
Hyperledger Fabric nodes.
* Deploy a Node.js app that will interact with our deployed smart contract.

# Flow Description
1. The blockchain operator sets up the IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 service.
2. The IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 creates a Hyperledger Fabric network on an IBM Kubernetes 
Service, and the operator installs and instantiates the smart contract on the network.
3. The Node.js application server uses the Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network on IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 and creates APIs for a web client.
4. The Vue.js client uses the Node.js application API to interact with the network.
5. The user interacts with the Vue.js web interface to cast their ballot and
and query the world state to see current poll standings.

## Prerequisites (Cloud)

This Cloud pattern assumes you have an **IBM Cloud account**.
  - [IBM Cloud account](https://tinyurl.com/y4mzxow5)
  - [Node v8.x or greater and npm v5.x or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

You do not technically need VSCode or the IBM Blockchain Platform extension for VSCode if you are running the 
Cloud pattern, but if you want to make any changes to the smart contract, you will need the
extension to package your smart contract project. 


## Prerequisites (Local)
If you want to run this pattern locally, without any Cloud services, then all you need is VSCode and the
IBM Blockchain Platform extension. 
- [Install VSCode version 1.39](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_39)
- [Install IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VSCode](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension)
- [Node v8.9.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm v6.11.3](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

**ðŸš§ðŸš§Note: you will need Node 8.x to run this pattern!ðŸš§ðŸš§**

For example, to install and run Node 8.9.0: 

```bash
  brew install nvm
  nvm install 8.9.0
  nvm use 8.9.0
```  


# Steps (Local Deployment)
> To run a local network, you can find steps [here](./docs/run-local.md).

# Steps (Cloud Deployment)
1. [Clone the Repo](#step-1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create IBM Cloud services](#step-2-create-ibm-cloud-services)
3. [Build a network](#step-3-build-a-network)
4. [Deploy voterContract Smart Contract on the network](#step-4-deploy-voterContract-smart-contract-on-the-network)
5. [Connect application to the network](#step-5-connect-application-to-the-network)
6. [Run the application](#step-6-run-the-application)

## Step 1. Clone the Repo

Git clone this repo onto your computer in the destination of your choice, then go into the web-app folder:
```
HoreaPorutiu$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/evote
```

## Step 2. Create IBM Cloud services

* Create the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/infrastructure/containers-kubernetes).  You can find the service in the `Catalog`.  For this code pattern, we can use the `Free` cluster, and give it a name.  Note, that the IBM Cloud allows one instance of a free cluster and expires after 30 days. <b>The cluster takes around 20
minutes to provision, so please be patient!</b>

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/createIKS.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Create the [IBM Blockchain Platform](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/blockchain/) service on the IBM Cloud.  You can find the service in the `Catalog`, and give a name.

* After your Kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can deploy your IBM Blockchain Platform service on the cluster. The service walks through few steps and finds your cluster on the IBM Cloud to deploy the service on.

* In the gif below, you can see me choosing my free cluster to deploy my IBM Blockchain Platform.

* Once the Blockchain Platform is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster (which can 
take a couple of minutes, you can launch the console to start operating on your
blockchain network by clicking on *Launch the IBM Blockchain Platform*.

<br>

## Step 3. Build a network

We will build a network as provided by the IBM Blockchain Platform [documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/blockchain/howto/ibp-console-build-network.html#ibp-console-build-network).  This will include creating a channel with a single peer organization with its own MSP and CA (Certificate Authority), and an orderer organization with its own MSP and CA. We will create the respective identities to deploy peers and operate nodes.

  - Download the connection profile by scrolling down and clicking <b>Download Connection Profile</b>.  This will download the connection json which we will use soon to establish connection.
  - You can click <b>Close</b> once the download completes.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/downloadCCP.gif">
</p>
<br>

* #### Create an application admin
  - Go to the <b>Nodes</b> tab on the left bar, and under <b>Certificate Authorities</b>, choose your organization CA, <b>Voter CA</b>.
  - Click on <b>Register user</b>.
  - Give an <b>Enroll ID</b> and <b>Enroll Secret</b> to administer your application users, `app-admin` and `app-adminpw`.

  - Click <b>Register user</b>.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/appAdmin.gif">
</p>
<br>


* #### Update application connection
  - Copy the connection profile you downloaded into [server folder](./web-app/server)
  - Rename the connection profile you downloaded **ibpConnection.json**
  - Update the [config.json](server/config.json) file with:
    - `ibpConnection.json`.
    - The <b>enroll id</b> and <b>enroll secret</b> for your app admin, which we earlier provided as `app-admin` and `app-adminpw`.
    - The orgMSP ID, which we provided as `votermsp`.
    - The caName, which can be found in your connection json file under "organization" -> "votermsp" -> certificateAuthorities". This would be like an IP address and a port. You should also use the `https` version of the certificateAuthorities line.
    - The peerName, which can be found in your connection json file under "organization" -> "votermsp" -> peers". This would be like an IP address and a port.
    - The username you would like to register.
    - Update gateway discovery to `{ enabled: true, asLocalhost: false }` to connect to IBP.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/updateConfig.gif">
</p>
<br>

- Once you are done, the final version of the **config.json** should look something like this:

```js
{
    "connection_file": "ibpConnection.json",
    "appAdmin": "app-admin",
    "appAdminSecret": "app-adminpw",
    "orgMSPID": "votermsp",
    "caName": "https://173.193.106.28:32634",
    "userName": "V1",
    "gatewayDiscovery": { "enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false }
}
```


## Step 6. Run the application

* #### Enroll admin
  - First, navigate to the `web-app/server` directory, and install the node dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd web-app/server
    npm install
    ```
  
  - Run the `enrollAdmin.js` script
    ```bash
    node enrollAdmin.js
    ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
    ```bash
    msg: Successfully enrolled admin user app-admin and imported it into the wallet
    ```

  - Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/startServer.gif">
</p>
<br>

* #### Start the web client
  - In a new terminal, open the `web-app/client` folder from the root directory. 
  Install the required dependencies with `npm install`.
    ```bash
    cd web-app/client
    npm install
    ```

  - Start the client:
    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```

  - In a browser of your choice, go to http://localhost:8080/#/.  If all goes well, you should see 
  something like the gif below:

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/runClient.gif">
</p>
<br>

You can find the app running at http://localhost:8080/  If all goes well, you should be greeted 
with the homepage that says <b>2020 Presidential Election</b>

Now, we can start interacting with the app.

First, we need to register as a voter, and create our digital identity with 
which we will submit our vote with. To do this, we will need to enter 
a uniqueId (drivers license) with a registrarId, and our first and last names.
After we do that, and click `register` the world state will be updated with 
our voterId and our name and registrarId.

If all goes well, you should see `voter with voterId {} is updated in the world state. Use voterId to login above.`
<b>Note: on the first try, the app can take a second to start up. If you click on `register` and nothing 
happens, try to fill in the form and click register again!</b>

Next, we can login to the app with our voterId.

Once we login, we can cast our vote. We will use our voterId again to cast our 
vote. Since we are voting for the presidential
election for 2020, we can choose the party of our liking. Once we are done, we
can choose submit, and then our vote is cast. As long as this voterId hasn't 
voted before, all is well. Next, we can view the poll standings by clicking
`Get Poll Standings` and clicking `Check Poll`. This will query the world 
state and get the current number of votes for each political party.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/demo.gif">
</p>
<br>

If we want to query for a particular voterId, we can do so in the `Query by Key` tab.
If we want to query by object, we can do so by clicking on the `Query by Type` 
tab, and entering a type, such as `voter`. This will return all voter objects 
that are currently in the state. `QueryAll` will return all objects in the state.

## Extending the code pattern
Pull requests and contribution are always welcome. Remember that a code pattern is a path to a solution, 
and not a complete solution on its own. To make this a more complete solution,
this application can be expanded in a couple of ways:

  * Use an API to verify the drivers license to make sure it is valid, and registered with the DMV.
  * Use a more complex consensus mechanism where multiple organizations (DMV, US Federal Government, US State
  Government) have to approve a vote before it is successfully recorded onto the blockchain.
  * Use ordering service which uses Raft consensus mechanism.
