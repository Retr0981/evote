# Create a fair evoting application to ensure correct election results with Hyperledger Fabric and IBM Blockchain Platform (Local)

# Steps (Local Deployment)

1. [Clone the Repo](#step-1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Start the Fabric Runtime](#step-2-start-the-fabric-runtime)
3. [Install Contract](#step-3-install-contract)
4. [Instantiate Contract](#step-4-Instantiate-contract)
5. [Export Connection Details](#step-5-export-connection-details)
6. [Run the App](#step-5-run-the-app)

Note: This repo assumes you have [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 
and [IBM Blockchain VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBMBlockchain.ibm-blockchain-platform) installed. If you don't, first install the 
latest version of VSCode, and then install the IBM Blockchain VSCode extension ensuring you 
have the correct [system requirements](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBMBlockchain.ibm-blockchain-platform) to run the extension. You will need Docker as 
this is how the extension builds a development Hyperledger Fabric network with a click of a button.

## Step 1. Clone the Repo

Git clone this repo onto your computer in the destination of your choice, then go into the web-app folder:
```
HoreaPorutiu$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/evote
```

## Step 2. Start the Fabric Runtime
![startRuntime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10428517/76370968-dea3ae80-62f5-11ea-8793-d04610e8bf30.gif)

- If you get errors like the gRPC error, you may need to download an earlier version of VSCode (1.39) (here)[https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_39]. Note that if you are using Mac, make sure the VSCode in your ~/Applications
folder shows version 1.39 when you click on show details. You may need to 
move newer version into the trash, and then empty the trash for the older 
version to work.

- First, we need to go to our IBM Blockchain Extension. Click on the IBM Blockchain icon
  in the left side of VSCode (It looks like a square). 
- Next, start your local fabric by clicking on 
  *1 Org Local Fabric* in the **FABRIC ENVIRONMENTS** pane.
  
- Once the runtime is finished starting (this might take a couple of minutes), under *Local Fabric* you should see *Smart Contracts* and a section for both *installed* and *instantiated*.

## Step 3. Import Install and Instantiate Contract
ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨Note that the gif shows the process for importing a contract, but uses a different smart contract. The process is the same, so use the gifs for help, but know that we are using the voterContract.ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
![importContract](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10428517/76371236-e0ba3d00-62f6-11ea-82a1-bfa4798985b9.gif)
- Next, we have to import our contract before we can install it. Click on 
**View -> Open Command Pallette -> Import Smart Contract**. Next, click 
on the `voterContract@7.0.0.cds` file that is in the `evote/contract` folder. 

- Under **FABRIC ENVIRONMENTS** let's click on *+ Install* and choose the peer that is available. Then the extension will ask you which package to 
 install. Choose *voterContract@7.0.0.cds*.
- Lastly, we need to instantiate the contract to be able to submit transactions 
on our network. Click on *+ Instantiate* and then choose *voterContract@7.0.0.cds*.
- When promted for a function enter init, as shown below.
![packageFile](/docs/function.png)

- When prompted for a private data collection, or and endorsement 
policy, hit `enter` on your keyboard, which will take all of the defaults.
- This will instantiate the smart contract. This may take some time. You should see the contract under the *instantiated* tab on the left-hand side, once it 
is finished instantiating.

## Step 4. Export Connection Details
![export](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10428517/76371002-fd09aa00-62f5-11ea-9f6b-cc25e68c410e.gif)

- Connect to the "Local Fabric - Org1" gateway as `admin`.  Right click on the 3 dot menu on the **FABRIC GATEWAYS** pane and `Export Connection Profile` Save this file to <git_tree>/evote/web-app/server/fabric_connection.json. **Note that this gif is here to show you the VSCode interface, it saves the files somewhere else.**


## Step 5. Export Local Wallet

![wallet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10428517/76375176-65f71f00-6302-11ea-8071-d68192905a91.gif)

- ðŸš¨Under the `FABRIC WALLETS` pane, click on `1 Org Local Fabric - Org1 Wallet`. Note this is very important, if you click on the Orderer wallet at the top, 
the application will not work! ðŸš¨
- Export the and save the wallet as `wallet` to 
<git_tree>/evote/web-app/server/wallet.
- Your final directory structure should look like the image below:
![dirStruct](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10428517/76990922-fbe40880-6905-11ea-8695-d0f7f6dbbd3b.png)

#### Update Config

Next, update the `config.json` file so it looks like this:

```json
{
  "connection_file": "fabric_connection.json",
  "appAdmin": "admin",
  "appAdminSecret": "adminpw",
  "orgMSPID": "Org1MSP",
  "caName": "ca.org1.example.com",
  "userName": "V1",
  "gatewayDiscovery": { "enabled": true, "asLocalhost": true }
}
```
This will ensure we use the admin identity that is stored in our wallet to sign transactions, 
and let the network know that the transactions that are coming from this certain identity were 
first signed off by the certificate authority with the name `ca.org1.example.com`.

## Step 6. Run the App
To run the app, we will need to install dependencies for both our front-end and our back-end. 

#### Start the Server
  - First, navigate to the `server` directory, and install the node dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd evote/web-app/server
    npm install
    ```
  - Then, start the server: 
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
  - If all goes well, you should see the following in your terminal:
    ```
      > server@1.0.0 start /Users/Horea.Porutiu@ibm.com/Workdir/testDir/July7/evote/web-app/server
      > ./node_modules/nodemon/bin/nodemon.js src/app.js

      [nodemon] 1.19.1
      [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
      [nodemon] watching: *.*
      [nodemon] starting `node src/app.js`  
    ```

#### Start the Front-end (Client)

- First, navigate to the `client` directory, and install the node dependencies.
  ```bash
  cd evote/web-app/client
  npm install
  ```
- Then, start the client: 
  ```bash
  npm run serve
  ```
- If all goes well, you should see the following in your terminal:
  ```
      DONE  Compiled successfully in 6803ms                                                                                             11:48:20

      App running at:
      - Local:   http://localhost:8080/ 
      - Network: unavailable

      Note that the development build is not optimized.
      To create a production build, run npm run build. 
  ```

 Nice. We're pretty much ready to submit transactions on our contract. Go to http://localhost:8080/ 
 to see your app.

 Go ahead and register a voter, login with your VoterId, and submit a vote. Have fun! :)
